title: "Readable code with base R (part 2)"
description: |
  It's been a while since my 
  [first post ](https://rpahl.github.io/r-some-blog/posts/readable-code-part1/)
  about this topic.
  Nevertheless, it remains an important issue as (in my humble view) there is
  still too much code appearing in R packages that lacks good readability. 
  So I hope this post helps to promote the beauty of readable code.

### Combine `startsWith` and `endsWith` with R's pipe

In my 
[first post ](https://rpahl.github.io/r-some-blog/posts/readable-code-part1/),
`startsWith` and `endsWith` were presented. In combination with R's pipe
operator, we can improve the readability even further.

```{r}
w <- "Hello World!"

w |> startsWith("Hell")

w |> endsWith("!")
```

Proceeding with the example of the initial post, let's see this in context of
control flow.

```{r}
tell_file_type <- function(filename)
{
    if (filename |> endsWith("txt"))
        print("A text file.")
    
    excel_endings <- c("xlsx", "xls")
    if (any(filename |> endsWith(excel_endings)))
        print("An Excel file.")
    
}
tell_file_type("A.xlsx")
```


### `%in% and %not in%`

The `%in%` operator is commonly used. To improve the readability of something like

```{r, eval = FALSE}
existing_names <- c("Lisa", "Bob")
name <- "Peter"
hasNewName = !(name %in% existing_names)
```

you can always define your own operators.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
`%not in%` <- Negate(`%in%`)

hasNewName = name %not in% existing_names
```

Obviously, the readability also depends on the choice of proper variable names.
My general take on this: don't shy away from longish variable names, if it
improves code readability.

In this context, it is often useful to assign boolean values to variables.
For example, instead of

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (abs_error < 1e-8) {
    # ...
}
```

you should do

```{r, eval = FALSE}
hasConverged <- abs_error < 1e-8

if (hasConverged) {
    # ...
}
```

That is, it is ok to add redundancies in your code if it improves readability.

Sometimes, it is not immediately clear from the naming of base R functions,
what they do. Of course, you are free to redefine them with a proper name.

```{r}
equals_pattern = function(x, pattern, ...) grepl(pattern, x, ...)

x <- "Peter"

x |> equals_pattern("^P")
```

Lastly, let's combine all of the above.

```{r}
x |> equals_pattern("^P") && 
x |> startsWith("z")      &&
x %not in% existing_names 
```

That's it for now. Let me know in the comments how you think about this topic
or maybe you have another good example of readable code.
