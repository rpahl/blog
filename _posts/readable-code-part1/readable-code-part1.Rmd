title: "Readable code with base R (part 1)"
description: |
  Producing readable R code is of great importance, especially if there is a 
  chance that you will share your code with people other than your future self.
  In this series of blog posts, I will present some (often underused) base R 
  functions for this purpose.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

```{r out.width = '60%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("easy-read.png")
```

In this post, we cover `startsWith`, `endsWith`, and `Filter`.

### `startsWith` and `endsWith` for string-matching

There are special base functions for pre- or postfix matching.

```{r}
# Basic usage:
w <- "Hello World!"
startsWith(w, "Hell")

startsWith(w, "Helo")

endsWith(w, "!")
```

Of course, it also works with vectors. Can't remember the exact name of a base function? Try this... ;)

```{r, include=T}
base_funcs <- ls("package:base")

base_funcs[startsWith(base_funcs, "row")]
```

The 'readable' property really shines when combined with control-flow.

```{r}
tell_file_type <- function(fn) {
    # Check different file endings
    if (endsWith(fn, "txt")) {
        print("A text file.")
    }
    if (any(endsWith(fn, c("xlsx", "xls")))) {
        print("An Excel file.")
    }
}
tell_file_type("A.txt")

tell_file_type("B.xls")
```

The resulting code reads very well.

### `Filter`
Using another nice base function, `Filter`, the above code can be further improved.

```{r}
get_file_type <- function(fn) {
  file_endings <- c(text="txt", Excel="xls", Excel="xlsx")  
  Filter(file_endings, f = function(x) endsWith(fn, x))
}

get_file_type("C.xlsx")
```

Again, very readable to my eyes. It should be noted that for this particular problem using `tools::file_ext` is even more appropriate, but I think the point has been made.

Last but not least, since `Filter` works on lists, you can use it on a `data.frame` as well.

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(A=1:3, B=5:3, L=letters[1:3])
dat

Filter(dat, f = is.numeric)

Filter(dat, f = Negate(is.numeric))  # or Filter(dat, f = function(x) !is.numeric(x))
```

That's it for now - see you in part 2.
