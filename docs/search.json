Basically,\r\nthe athlete runs three-minute intervals on a treadmill with constant speed,\r\nstarting very low. At the end of each interval, the trainer\r\nnotes the heart frequency (HF) and the speed is increased. Due to the fact that\r\nVO2max more or less is linearly related to heart frequency and running speed,\r\nthe VO2max can be determined quite accurately with 5-6 data points without having\r\nto reach max HF (although the max HF must be known and entered in the app).\r\n\r\nSquash match simulator\r\n\r\n\r\nsquash-sim simulates Squash matches\r\nbased on simple Bernoulli probabilities. The motivation was to develop an\r\nintuition about how much luck is involved in the game. For example, if both\r\nplayers are equal in strength, it is not rare that a player wins 3-0.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
