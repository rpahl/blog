Recently managed to put up my new package [container](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/container/index.html) on CRAN (and finally have a compelling reason to start an R-blog ...). This package provides some common container data structures deque, set and dict (resembling [Python](https://www.python.org/)s dict type), with typical member functions to insert, delete and access container elements. 

If you work with (especially bigger) R scripts, a specialized `container` may safe you some time and errors, for example, to avoid accidently overwriting existing list elements. Also, being based on [R6](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=R6), all `container` objects provide reference semantics.

### Example: dict vs list
Here are a (very) few examples comparing the standard `list` with the `dict` container. For more examples see the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/container/vignettes/overview.html).

#### Init and print
```{r}
library(container)
l <- list(A1=1:3, L=letters[1:3])
print(l)
```
There are many ways to initialize a dict - one of them is passing a standard `list`. The `print` method provides compact output similar to `base::str`.
```{r}
d <- Dict$new(l)
print(d) 
```


#### Access elements
Accessing non-existing elements often gives unexpected results and can lead to nasty and hard-to-spot errors.
```{r}
sum <- l[["A1"]] + l[["B1"]]
sum
```
The dict provides intended behaviour (in this case stops with an error).
```{r sum, error=TRUE}
sum <- d$get("A1") + d$get("B1")
```

Catching such cases manually is rather cumbersome.
```{r}
robust_sum <- l[["A1"]] + ifelse("B1" %in% names(l), l[["B1"]], 0)
robust_sum
```
The `peek` method returns the value only if it exists. The resulting code is not only shorter but also easier to read due to the intended behaviour being expressed more clearly.
```{r}
robust_sum <- d$get("A1") + d$peek("B1", default=0)
robust_sum
```


#### Set elements
A similar problem occurs when overwriting existing elements.
```{r}
l[["L"]] <- 0  # letters are gone
l
```

The `add` method prevents any accidental overwrite.
```{r, error=TRUE}
d$add("L", 0)

# If overwrite is intended, use 'set'
d$set("L", 0)
d

# Setting non-existing elements also raises an error, unless adding is intended
d$set("M", 1)
d$set("M", 1, add=TRUE)  # alternatively: d$add("M", 1)
```

Removing existing/non-existing elements can be controlled in a similar way. Again, see the package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/container/vignettes/overview.html) for more examples.

#### Reference semantics
```{r}
d$size()
remove_from_dict_at <- function(d, x) d$remove(x) 
remove_from_dict_at(d, "L")
remove_from_dict_at(d, "M")
d$size()

backup <- d$clone()
remove_from_dict_at(d, "A1")
d
backup
```
